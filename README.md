# 90s-Website

This assignment was very eye opening to me. I started this cohort with basically no coding experience and I was thrilled to see a website start coming to life. Although it is extremely rudimentary, I am happy with how it looks. Although I could go back to make changes and add functionality, I think that would skew the representation of my knowledge and skill at the time.
